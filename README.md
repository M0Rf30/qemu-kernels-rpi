# Description
QEMU kernel builds for Raspberry Pi devices and a very awful script to compile them.

# Requirements
Please install the required toolchain for arm:
* arm-none-eabi (for arm)
* aarch64-linux-gnu (for arm64)

Remember to install these packages:
* ccache (to speedup frequent builds)

# How to use
Take a look at different ```m0rf30/qemu-kernel-*``` repos for detailed instructions

# Pull requests
Any suggestion are welcome.

Feel free to fork, improve, test and do PR.
